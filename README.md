# Let's Get Baking
<hr>

My project is an online recipe book for cakes. The users can view all the recipes that have been added to the website by the recipe book page
or sign up to the website and add their own to share with everyone else. Logged in users can view all the recipes they have added via the
profile page, there they can edit their recipes or even delete them if they wish.
